.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility offers combined kernel and base system upgrades using
remotely fetched binary sets, as well as package upgrades via
.Xr pkg 8 .
.Pp
Options
.Sq Fl b ,
.Sq Fl k ,
.Sq Fl p
and
.Sq Fl t
may be stacked to create selective updates.
The default is
.Sq Fl bkp ,
attempting to update all installed components at once using
a minor upgrade sequence.
.Pp
Major upgrades are invoked using
.Sq Fl u
instead.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl m Ar mirror_url" -offset indent
.It Fl a Ar abi
Change the
.Ar abi
from the detected default to a specific value.
This does not affect
.Sq Fl p .
.It Fl B
Execute single-step base system upgrade after use of
.Sq Fl u .
Implies
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl b
Select the base system.
.It Fl c
Check whether a set update can be performed, but do not install it.
When using
.Sq Fl p ,
the major upgrade hint file is checked for existence only.
.It Fl D Ar device
Device type for the kernel to be loaded.
If unset it is automatically detected.
.It Fl d
Restore the repository defaults.
.It Fl e
Empty the cache directory.
.It Fl f
Force an update even when the latest release is already installed.
.It Fl i
Ignore the signature verification result.
Otherwise, the
.Xr opnsense-verify 8
utility is used to verify a set signature.
The default is off meaning secure, unless the package mirror
configuration does not use fingerprints.
.It Fl k
Select the kernel.
.It Fl L
Lock a set to avoid updates.
The lock will be stripped by
.Sq Fl U
or
.Sq Fl u ,
and ingored temporarily by
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl l Ar directory
Instead of downloading, point to a local directory where sets are located.
.It Fl M
Return the full release URL of the selected mirror.
.It Fl m Ar mirror_url
Change the set fetch and package location to
.Ar mirror .
.It Fl N Ar crypto_lib
When using
.Sq Fl up ,
the cryptographic library may be specified.
Possible values are
.Sq OpenSSL
or
.Sq LibreSSL .
The value
.Sq Base
is reserved for future use.
.It Fl n Ar mirror_dir
Change the mirror directory to
.Ar mirror_dir .
.It Fl P
Execute single-step packages upgrade after use of
.Sq Fl u .
Implies
.Sq Fl f .
.It Fl p
Select the packages.
.It Fl R
Select the major release from the upgrade hint file if found.
Otherwise,
.Sq unknown
is used to signify the hint is missing and the major update
cannot be reached.
.It Fl r Ar release
Select the
.Ar release
to be installed.
Package upgrades are unaffected by this option when not using
.Sq Fl u .
.It Fl s
Skip update phase; useful in conjunction with
.Sq Fl m
and
.Sq Fl n .
.It Fl S
Return the download size of the requested remote set.
.It Fl T
Probe the lock status of the requested set,
exiting with an error if the respective set is locked.
.It Fl t Ar type
Switch to the release package
.Ar type ,
properly handling the
.Xr pkg 8
.Sq vital
flag transition.
The
.Xr opnsense-version 8
utility is used to test which version is currently installed.
.It Fl U
Unlock a set to allow updates.
Sets are generally unlocked unless
.Sq Fl L
was used.
.It Fl u
Invoke the major upgrade if known or set manually using
.Sq Fl r Ar release .
In order to finish the upgrade,
.Sq Fl B
and
.Sq Fl P
must be invoked in this particular order, accompanied by a reboot
after each individual step.
.It Fl V
Set debug mode for shell script output.
.It Fl v
Print the latest set version.
.It Fl z
Use the snapshot directory to fetch sets regardless of what is
currently configured in the repository file.
This does not affect
.Sq Fl p .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Pa /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/OPNsense.conf
The
.Xr pkg.conf 5
file used to configure the packages mirror.
The file is rewritten in case of
.Sq Fl d ,
.Sq Fl m
or
.Sq Fl n .
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/firmware-upgrade
This file contains a hint at the major release and will be
automatically read using
.Sq Fl R
and
.Sq Fl u
unless
.Sq Fl r Ar release
was given.
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/base
The file is used to check if a base system upgrade is necessary.
It is embedded into the base set.
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/base.lock
The lock for preventing an update to the base system,
operated by
.Sq Fl \&Lb
and
.Sq Fl \&Ub .
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/base.obsolete
The file is used to list files to be removed after installation
which are no longer required.
It is embedded into the base set.
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/core.lock
The lock for preventing an update to all packages,
operated by
.Sq Fl \&Lp
and
.Sq Fl \&Up .
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/kernel
The file is used to check if a kernel upgrade is necessary.
It is embedded into the kernel set.
.It Pa /usr/local/opnsense/version/kernel.lock
The lock for preventing updates to the kernel,
operated by
.Sq Fl \&Lk
and
.Sq Fl \&Uk .
.It Pa /var/cache/opnsense-update
The local cache storage directory.
