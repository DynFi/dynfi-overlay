This is the FreeBSD port of the OpenBSD dhcrelay daemons.

A relay allows to forward DHCP requests to remote DHCP servers which are
not found in the same broadcast domain.  Due to ISC DHCPD being end of
life this separately maintained daemon acts as a simple replacement with
minimal syntax changes.  Its main features are privilege separation and
the ability to run multiple daemons in parallel.
